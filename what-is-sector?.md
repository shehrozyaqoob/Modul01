h1Sector
On a computer diskette or hard disk, a sector is one of the "pie slices" the diskette or disk is divided into. Dividing the 
circular medium into pie slices is a way to organize it so that data can be located by the read/write heads of the drive. The 
diskette or disk is also divided into a number of concentric circles. Data can be located by knowing the number of the sector and 
the concentric track that passes through that sector. Each track is divided into a number of clusters that represent the smallest 
unit of storage that is addressable (can be written to or read). Typically, a Sector is 12 bytes in length.
